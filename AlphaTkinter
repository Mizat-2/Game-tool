#Maybe create a list of all LRs in game, and a visual way to distinguish what you have. 

#Buttons for each type in game Str, Teq, Int, Phy, Agl
#with colors corrosponding Red, Green, Purple, Orange, Blue
#buttons show LRs you own, or have the base unit SSR or UR/TUR and Medals needed

#After that is done along with a list of all LRs with images, stats for each LR. 
#The 20 SA multiplyer
#maybe choice of putting in your progress on each S.A and Hidden Potential. So you know how to dedicate resources.

#Also a few more LR based stats and images maybe added. 
#As a second tab, or another window or part (somehow) intergrate a calculator for damage output.
#Damage calc for your LRs and what they should hit a few of the event bosses for. 
#This damage calc would be an ideal tool to use next to a team builder.
